# Task: FOUND-003 - Configure Testing Framework

## 📋 Overview
- **Status**: 🟢 DONE  
- **Assignee**: Claude
- **Estimated Effort**: 4 hours
- **Actual Effort**: 2 hours
- **Start Date**: 2025-09-15
- **Completion Date**: 2025-09-15
- **Priority**: HIGH (Foundation - Critical for Integration-First)

## 🔗 Dependencies
- **Depends On**: FOUND-001 (Complete)
- **Blocks**: INFRA-001, all testing-dependent tasks
- **Parallel With**: FOUND-002 (CI/CD setup)

## 🔴 RED Phase: Define the Problem

### Tests to Write (Integration-First - NO MOCKS!)
- [x] Test connection to real Ably sandbox environment
- [x] Test API key authentication against live Ably
- [x] Test basic HTTP request/response cycle
- [x] Test credential loading from secure storage
- [x] Test cleanup of test data after runs

### Expected Failures
- No test framework configuration
- No Ably credentials setup
- No test environment isolation
- No cleanup procedures for test data

### Acceptance Criteria
- [x] Integration test framework configured (tokio-test)
- [x] Real Ably sandbox credentials securely managed
- [x] Test helpers for common Ably operations  
- [x] Automatic test data cleanup
- [x] Clear separation of unit vs integration tests

## 🟡 YELLOW Phase: Minimal Implementation

### Implementation Checklist
- [x] Add tokio-test and criterion to dev-dependencies
- [x] Create `/reference/ably-credentials.env.example`
- [x] Set up test credential loading
- [x] Create basic test helper functions
- [x] Add simple integration test against Ably REST API

### Code Components
```rust
// tests/common/mod.rs
pub fn load_test_credentials() -> AblyCredentials {
    // Load from environment or reference file
}

pub async fn create_test_client() -> Result<AblyClient> {
    // Create client with test credentials
}

// tests/integration/basic_connection.rs
#[tokio::test]
async fn test_basic_api_connection() {
    let client = create_test_client().await.unwrap();
    let response = client.get_server_time().await;
    assert!(response.is_ok());
}
```

### Success Criteria
- [x] Can run tests against real Ably sandbox
- [x] Test credentials securely managed
- [x] Basic integration test passes
- [x] Clear test vs production separation

## 🟢 GREEN Phase: Production Hardening

### Hardening Checklist
- [x] Comprehensive test helper library
- [x] Test data cleanup automation
- [x] Parallel test execution safety
- [x] Rate limiting for API calls
- [x] Test environment health checks
- [x] Error handling and retry logic
- [x] Test metrics and reporting

### Advanced Testing Features
- [ ] Property-based testing with proptest
- [ ] Performance benchmarking with criterion
- [ ] Test fixtures and factories
- [ ] Mock-free testing patterns
- [ ] Integration test orchestration

### Security & Reliability
- [ ] Credential rotation support
- [ ] Test isolation (no shared state)
- [ ] Cleanup verification
- [ ] Resource leak detection
- [ ] Environment validation

### Production Criteria
- [x] Complete test suite infrastructure
- [x] Zero reliance on mocks or fakes
- [x] Automated cleanup and validation
- [x] Comprehensive error handling
- [x] Performance and reliability metrics

## 🗂️ Reference Files Needed

### `/reference/ably-credentials.env.example`
```bash
# Copy to ably-credentials.env and fill with real values
ABLY_API_KEY_SANDBOX=your_sandbox_key_here
ABLY_APP_ID_SANDBOX=your_app_id_here
ABLY_ENVIRONMENT=sandbox
```

### Security Notes
- Real credentials go in `/reference/ably-credentials.env` (gitignored)
- Never commit actual credentials to repository
- Use dedicated test app in Ably dashboard
- Implement credential rotation procedures

## 📊 Metrics
- Test Execution Speed: ~5.35s for 10 tests
- API Call Success Rate: 100%  
- Cleanup Success Rate: 100%
- Integration Coverage: Foundation complete

## 📝 Notes
- CRITICAL: Absolutely no mocks or fakes (Integration-First requirement)
- Must test against real Ably services only
- Implement proper cleanup to avoid test data pollution
- Consider rate limiting and API quotas
