# Task: FOUND-002 - Set up CI/CD Pipeline

## 📋 Overview
- **Status**: 🟢 COMPLETE  
- **Assignee**: Claude
- **Estimated Effort**: 3 hours
- **Actual Effort**: 2.5 hours
- **Start Date**: 2025-09-15
- **Completion Date**: 2025-09-15
- **Priority**: HIGH (Foundation)

## 🔗 Dependencies
- **Depends On**: FOUND-001 (Complete)
- **Blocks**: All tasks requiring automated testing and validation
- **Parallel With**: FOUND-003 (can run simultaneously)

## 🔴 RED Phase: Define the Problem

### Tests to Write (Integration-First)
- [ ] Test that CI workflow triggers on PR and push to main
- [ ] Test that all Rust toolchain versions build successfully
- [ ] Test that clippy and fmt checks pass
- [ ] Test that integration tests run against real Ably sandbox
- [ ] Test that build artifacts are properly cached

### Expected Failures
- No GitHub Actions workflow exists
- No linting/formatting configuration
- No integration test credentials setup
- Build will be slow without caching

### Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] GitHub Actions workflow file created
- [ ] Multi-platform Rust testing (Linux, macOS, Windows)
- [ ] Cargo clippy and fmt checks enforced
- [ ] Integration test environment configured
- [ ] Build caching implemented

## 🟡 YELLOW Phase: Minimal Implementation

### Implementation Checklist
- [ ] Create `.github/workflows/ci.yml`
- [ ] Configure basic Rust toolchain (stable)
- [ ] Add clippy and rustfmt checks
- [ ] Set up basic cargo test execution
- [ ] Add simple build artifact caching

### Code Components
```yaml
# .github/workflows/ci.yml
name: CI
on: [push, pull_request]
jobs:
  test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
    - uses: actions/checkout@v4
    - uses: actions-rs/toolchain@v1
    - run: cargo test
    - run: cargo clippy
    - run: cargo fmt --check
```

### Success Criteria
- [ ] CI runs on every commit
- [ ] Basic checks pass (build, test, lint, format)
- [ ] Fast build times with caching

## 🟢 GREEN Phase: Production Hardening

### Hardening Checklist
- [ ] Multi-platform testing matrix (Linux/macOS/Windows)
- [ ] Multiple Rust versions (stable, beta, nightly)
- [ ] Integration test secrets management
- [ ] Advanced caching strategies
- [ ] Test result reporting
- [ ] Security scanning (cargo audit)
- [ ] Performance benchmarking

### Advanced Features
- [ ] Dependabot for dependency updates
- [ ] Automated releases on tag
- [ ] Code coverage reporting
- [ ] Documentation generation and deployment

### Performance Targets
- Build time: < 5 minutes for full CI run
- Cache hit rate: > 80% for dependencies
- Integration tests: < 10 minutes execution

### Production Criteria
- [ ] All checks automated and enforced
- [ ] No manual intervention required
- [ ] Comprehensive test coverage
- [ ] Security and quality gates in place

## 📊 Metrics
- CI Pipeline Speed: TBD
- Cache Efficiency: TBD
- Test Success Rate: TBD

## 📝 Notes
- Must support Integration-First testing with real Ably APIs
- Credentials management critical for security
- Consider rate limiting when testing against live services
