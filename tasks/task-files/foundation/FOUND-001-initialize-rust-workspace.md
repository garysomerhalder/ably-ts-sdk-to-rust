# Task: FOUND-001 - Initialize Rust Workspace

## 📋 Overview
- **Status**: 🔴 TODO
- **Assignee**: Claude
- **Estimated Effort**: 2 hours
- **Actual Effort**: -
- **Start Date**: 2024-01-15
- **Completion Date**: -

## 🔗 Dependencies
- **Depends On**: None (first task)
- **Blocks**: FOUND-002, INFRA-001, all subsequent tasks

## 🔴 RED Phase: Define the Problem

### Tests to Write
- [ ] Test that workspace structure exists with correct crates
- [ ] Test that Cargo.toml has proper workspace configuration
- [ ] Test that each crate can be built independently
- [ ] Test that workspace dependencies are properly shared

### Expected Failures
- No Cargo.toml exists yet
- No crate structure defined
- Build commands will fail

### Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Workspace root Cargo.toml exists
- [ ] Multiple crate structure defined
- [ ] All crates listed in workspace
- [ ] Basic build succeeds

## 🟡 YELLOW Phase: Minimal Implementation

### Implementation Checklist
- [ ] Create root Cargo.toml with workspace definition
- [ ] Create ably-rust-core crate
- [ ] Create ably-rust-node crate (for Node.js bindings)
- [ ] Create ably-rust-wasm crate (for WebAssembly)
- [ ] Create ably-rust-ffi crate (for C FFI)
- [ ] Basic lib.rs for each crate

### Code Components
```
ably-rust/
├── Cargo.toml (workspace root)
├── ably-core/
│   ├── Cargo.toml
│   └── src/lib.rs
├── ably-node/
│   ├── Cargo.toml
│   └── src/lib.rs
├── ably-wasm/
│   ├── Cargo.toml
│   └── src/lib.rs
└── ably-ffi/
    ├── Cargo.toml
    └── src/lib.rs
```

### Success Criteria
- [ ] `cargo build` succeeds for workspace
- [ ] Each crate can be built independently
- [ ] No compilation errors

## 🟢 GREEN Phase: Production Hardening

### Hardening Checklist
- [ ] Add comprehensive workspace dependencies
- [ ] Configure feature flags for optional components
- [ ] Set up proper versioning strategy
- [ ] Add workspace-level lints and formatting
- [ ] Configure optimization levels
- [ ] Add documentation comments

### Dependencies to Add
```toml
# Core dependencies
tokio = "1.40"
reqwest = "0.12"
tokio-tungstenite = "0.24"
serde = { version = "1.0", features = ["derive"] }
serde_json = "1.0"
rmp-serde = "1.3"
thiserror = "2.0"
tracing = "0.1"

# Bindings
napi = { version = "3.0", optional = true }
wasm-bindgen = { version = "0.2", optional = true }
```

### Performance Targets
- Build time: < 30 seconds for debug build
- Binary size: Core crate < 5MB
- Zero unsafe code in core (initially)

### Production Criteria
- [ ] All workspace metadata complete
- [ ] README.md for each crate
- [ ] License files included
- [ ] CI/CD ready structure
- [ ] Documentation builds with `cargo doc`

## 📊 Metrics
- Test Coverage: N/A (foundation task)
- Build Time: TBD
- Binary Size: TBD

## 📝 Notes
- This is the foundation task that all other work depends on
- Must establish clear crate boundaries for modular development
- Consider future platform support requirements
