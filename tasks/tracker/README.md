# Task Management System

## Overview
This directory contains the task tracking system for the Ably Rust SDK port project.

## Structure
```

â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ archive.md       # Completed tasks >30 days

â””â”€â”€ task-files/          # Implementation files
    â”œâ”€â”€ foundation/      # Project setup tasks
    â”œâ”€â”€ infrastructure/  # Core infrastructure tasks
    â”œâ”€â”€ core/           # Protocol and client tasks

```

## Task ID Convention
- FOUND-XXX: Foundation tasks
- INFRA-XXX: Infrastructure tasks
- CORE-XXX: Core implementation tasks
- FEAT-XXX: Feature tasks
- BIND-XXX: Binding tasks

## Traffic-Light Development
Each task follows three phases:
1. ðŸ”´ RED: Write failing tests against real Ably API
2. ðŸŸ¡ YELLOW: Minimal implementation to pass tests
3. ðŸŸ¢ GREEN: Production hardening with full features

## Integration-First Requirement
- NO mocks or fakes allowed
- All tests must use real Ably sandbox or production APIs
- Credentials stored in `/reference/` directory
