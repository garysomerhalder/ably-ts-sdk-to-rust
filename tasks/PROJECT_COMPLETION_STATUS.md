## 🔧 Working Features (Tested with Valid API Key)

### Confirmed Working
- ✅ REST API authentication with API key
- ✅ Time endpoint retrieval
- ✅ Message publishing to channels
- ✅ Basic channel operations
- ✅ HTTP resilience (retry, circuit breaker, rate limiting)
- ✅ Encryption/decryption with AES
- ✅ Plugin system architecture

### Partially Working  
- 🟡 Channel history (publishes work, retrieval has JSON issues)
- 🟡 Stats endpoint (JSON parsing errors)
- 🟡 Channel list (JSON parsing errors)
- 🟡 WebSocket connection (needs real-world testing)

## 🔴 Remaining Work

### High Priority Fixes
1. **JSON Response Parsing** - Align structs with actual API responses
2. **WebSocket Testing** - Validate real-time connection with API key
3. **Token Refresh** - Implement automatic token renewal
4. **Protocol Handlers** - Complete remaining message handlers

### Missing Features
5. **State Machine Logic** - Full connection/channel state transitions
6. **Message Acknowledgments** - ACK/NACK handling
7. **Connection Recovery** - Resume after disconnect
8. **Fallback Hosts** - Multiple endpoint support

## 📈 Progress by Phase

| Phase | Completion | Status |
|-------|------------|--------|
| Foundation | 100% | ✅ Complete |
| Infrastructure | 80% | 🟡 Nearly Complete |
| Client Implementation | 90% | 🟡 Mostly Complete |
| Advanced Features | 85% | 🟡 Mostly Complete |
| Platform Bindings | 100% | ✅ Complete |
| **Overall** | **~85%** | 🟡 **Beta Ready** |

## 🎯 Next Sprint Tasks
