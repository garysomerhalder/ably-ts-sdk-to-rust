# Ably SDK Credentials for Integration-First Testing
# Copy this file to ably-credentials.env and fill with real values
# 
# IMPORTANT: 
# - Use sandbox/test environment only
# - Never commit the real ably-credentials.env file
# - These credentials are for automated testing against real Ably APIs

# Ably Sandbox Environment
ABLY_API_KEY_SANDBOX=your_sandbox_api_key_here
ABLY_APP_ID_SANDBOX=your_sandbox_app_id_here
ABLY_ENVIRONMENT=sandbox

# GitHub Secrets (for CI/CD)
# Add these to your repository secrets:
# - ABLY_API_KEY_SANDBOX
# - ABLY_APP_ID_SANDBOX

# Usage Notes:
# - Load these in integration tests: load_dotenv("reference/ably-credentials.env")
# - CI/CD uses GitHub secrets for security
# - Local development uses local .env file
# - Never use production credentials for testing
